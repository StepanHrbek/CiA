Usage: FN [options] [source [destination]]
  -i show informations about source fonts, nothing more
  -f show formats description, nothing more
  -p convert font to proportional
  -nnumber convert font to no-proportional, number is width, none=autodetect
  -r rename font (name in header, not a filename)
  -first-last tells that font contains only chars first..last (eg. -32-255)
  -wnumber sets char width in FNT in pixels, 8 by default
  -snumber shifts all chars up (to create superscript)
  -k some conversion meaningful only for Czechs
  -v work out all fonts from a multifont file (.fon)
  -cword word found in each font header in multifont file, (c) by default
   (I have no .FON description, I detect subfonts by searching this word)
  :lang language selection (:eng or :cz)
  If you enter only source, font is set up on screen.
  If you enter also destination, program tries to convert.
  Both source and destination may contain * and ? (eg. FN *.fnt *.fn).

Formats (sorted by complexity):
  FNT - unpacked bitmaps, width 8 pixels, height autodetected
  FNP - as FNT but with byte width(1-24) before each bitmap
  RIF - magic "af"; pchar copyright; word height(0-24),lastchar (firstchar=32);
        table[word ofs_from_bitmaps_start,width(0-16)]; bitmaps heap
  FN  - magic "ëmÕonç "; pchar name; char firstchar,lastchar; short sizeover,
        sizeunder; short addspace; byte future; table[short relx,rely;
        byte width,height,shift; word ofs_from_file_start]; bitmaps heap
